Germany 's representative to the European Union 's veterinary committee Werner Zwingmann said on Wednesday consumers should buy sheepmeat from countries other than Britain until the scientific advice was clearer.
"We do n't support any such recommendation because we do n't see any grounds for it,"
"He said a proposal last month by EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler to ban sheep brains, spleens and spinal cords from the human and animal food chains was a highly specific and precautionary move to protect human health."
Fischler proposed EU-wide measures after reports from Britain and France that under laboratory conditions sheep could contract Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) -- mad cow disease.
